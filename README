Contains shell scripts that ease the installation of the vehicle simulator Rigs of Rods and its dependencies. 
They are designed for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint based systems, last tested on Ubuntu.

Run from console in this order and not simultaneously:
	sh RoRdepsapt.sh
	sh RoRdeps.sh
	sh RoRcore.sh
	sh RoRcontent.sh
    
to update to a newer version re-run
	sh RoRcore.sh
	
To change default directories and make options edit the "config" file.

I included a script for profiling. If you don't know what that means then it is not for you!


Note: If for whatever reason you copy parts of the script into the console make sure to set configuration
variables appropriately, either manually, or by sourcing the "config" file:

. ./config
