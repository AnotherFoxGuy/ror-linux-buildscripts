Contains shell scripts that ease the installation of the vehicle simulator Rigs of Rods and its dependencies. 
They are designed for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint based systems, last tested on Ubuntu.

Make them executable: chmod +x RoR*.sh
Run from console in this order and not simultaneously:
	sh RoRdepsapt.sh
	sh RoRdeps.sh
	sh RoRcore.sh
	sh RoRcontent.sh
    
to update to a newer version re-run
	sh RoRcore.sh
	
I included a script for profiling. If you don't know what that means then it is not for you!


Note: If for whatever reason you copy parts of the script into the console make sure that for "make -j$cpucount" either
1. $cpucount has the correct value ( e.g. set by "cpucount=$(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)" )
or
2. replace $cpucount with a number ( e.g. "make -j4" )

If $cpucount is not set correctly it will probably bring your system to a halt.
