Contains shell scripts that ease the installation of the vehicle simulator Rigs of Rods and its dependencies. 
They are designed for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint based systems, last tested on Ubuntu.

Make them executable: chmod +x RoR*.sh
Run from console in this order and not simultaneously:
	sh RoRdeps.sh
	sh RoRcore.sh
	sh RoRcontent.sh
    
to update to a newer version run
	sh RoRupdate.sh
	
I included a script for profiling. If you don't know what that means then it is not for you!
